and install the dependencis


```
npm install
```



### Prerequisites

A number of node.js tools is necessary to initialize and test the project. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from  [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). The tools/modules used in this project are listed in package.json and include express, mongodb and mongoose.

#### MongoDB

For further information about installing MONGO-DB you can directly visit their site.


### Start the MongoDB server
For local mongo-db server you need to install mongo-database & mongo shell. For further info you can visit MONGO-DB page.

### ENV Variables
To see the app working you neewd to configure env variables i.e Cloudinary, MONGO-ATLAS, MAPBOX.
You can avoid MONGO Atlas by using local mongo-db for which i have already configured the code.

### Run the Application

The project is preconfigured with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

    npm start build



The command will generate a /doc folder that will contain an index.html file. Open it in any browser. The file contains information about API routes.
